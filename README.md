# Tiling Problem Visualization

This repository contains a C++ program that tackles tiling problems using a recursive algorithm and provides visualizations using the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library.

## Introduction

Tiling problems involve dividing a given grid into smaller tiles or patterns in various ways. This project provides a visual representation of tiling solutions by employing a recursive algorithm. Users can interact with the program by clicking on the grid to mark tiles as empty (black), triggering the algorithm to recalculate and visualize the tiling process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this program, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **C++ Compiler**: You need a C++ compiler to build the program.
- **SDL Library**: The program utilizes the SDL library for graphics.
- **SDL_image Library**: This library is used for handling image files.

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the Tiling Problem Visualization program on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/sakshiBhegade/Recursive-TilingProblem-Visualizer.git
